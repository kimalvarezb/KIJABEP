            <div class="box">Computer Programmers are one of the most important jobs out there in the technology world. They are the back bone for most companies. They help communicate with the computer and the programs that are on them. Computer programmers write, test, 
                    and maintain the detailed instructions, called programs (Computer Programming Careers, Jobs, and Training Information). Now in this field what is exactly do I have to do to become a successful computer programmer? To become a programmer you must first go 
                    to college and get a bachelorâ€™s degree, but a two- year degree or certificate will be just fine for some jobs. Some hold a degree in computer science, mathematics, or information systems. Many may have also taken special courses in accounting, finance, or 
                    another area of business. While they are in school they learn a skill of communicating with the computer in another language.
